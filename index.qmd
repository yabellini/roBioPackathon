## Communities of Practice

> groups of people who **share a 
passion** for something that they **know 
how to do**, and who **interact regularly** 
in order to **learn how to do it better** -- _Etienne Wenger_

## rOpenSci {.smaller}

we are a group of people who passion is __open and reproducible research__ for everyone, build it by everyone. And we know how to do it by creating __technical and social infrastructure__.

::: {.notes}
We do this creating a suite of carefully vetted, federated R software tools. Developers of research software send their package to our review process, and after they pass, the package is part of our suite. Developers get support on from our staff and from the community. Users get high quality software to do science.

Making the right data, tools and best practices more discoverable. Our R-Universe platform allows to publish and search more than 18000 R packages. 

Welcoming and diverse community through a code of conduct, our Champions Program and our multilingual publishing efforts. 

Building capacity of software users and developers and fostering a sense of pride in their work with the projets I already mention, but also by publishing online books, organizing community call and co-working session, higlighing developer with interviews and creating contect on our web pages, forum and newsletter.

## How it works?

1. **Pre-inquiry** to check **scope** to our two software-review streams: scientific data lifecycles and statistical algorithms.

. . .

2. **Peer-review**: license, documentation, test coverage, usability, quality, stile.

. . .

3. **Accepted**: badge and add to our suite.
